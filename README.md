# The_Reason

For our final project, we will analyze a dataset on daily trending YouTube videos. We selected this topic because of curiosity about what it takes to create a trending video on YouTube, and what factors are more liekly to create a trending video.
We focused on the United States (USA) csv file that contains the video title, channel title, publish time, tags, views, likes and dislikes, description, and comment count, etc. The data was collected for several months and contains about 40,950 trending videos. We will analyze this data to get insights into YouTube trending videos in the USA, to answer the following questions: 

1. Which video category (e.g., Entertainment, Gaming, Comedy, etc.) has the largest number of trending videos and which video remained the most on the trending videos list?
1. How many views do our trending videos have? Is having a large number of views required for a video to become trending?
2. Which YouTube channels have the largest number of trending videos?
3. The average number of views of a trending video
4. The average number of likes for a trending video
5. The average number of comments for a trending video

The team will be meeting during regular class hours over Zoom (Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday) and primarily communicating in non office hours through Slack. Additional meetings times can be schduled as neccessary based on individual schedules.
