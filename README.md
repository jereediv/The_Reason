# The_Reason

## Segment 2 Deliverables
- The team will be meeting during regular class hours over Zoom (Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday) and primarily communicating in non office hours through Slack. Additional meetings times can be schduled as neccessary based on individual schedules.
- Project Outline
We looked at data for over 40,950 trending YouTube video from different countries to identity factors that contribute to a successful trending YouTube video.

Note: The descriptions and explanations required in all other project deliverables should also be in your README.md as part of your outline, unless otherwise noted.

# Presentation
- Topic: Analyzing daily trending YouTube videos
- Reason for Topic
    - We want to build a model that will predict the best time to post a trending video by factoring time, category, etc.
    - This information can be used by Youtubers that want build a successful page and companies that would want to Sponsor YouTube channels based on their views and audience reach
- Description of source data
    - The data source contains over 40,000 videos with columns for category, publish date, trending date, tags, titles, and views. We have reformatted the data set to show the difference in time between when the video was posted and when it went trending. We were also forced to remove the channel text as it ruined the machine learning model, requiring too many inputs from the user.
    - The dataset we used for our project is obtained from Kaggle:
