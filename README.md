# The_Reason

## Topic: Analyzing daily trending YouTube videos

We looked at data for over 40,950 trending YouTube video from different countries to identity factors that contribute to a successful trending YouTube video. 

Reason for Selecting Topic
-	We want to build a model that will predict the best time to post a trending video by factoring time, category, etc.  
-	This information can be used by Youtubers that want build a successful page and companies that would want to Sponsor YouTube channels based on their views and audience reach
